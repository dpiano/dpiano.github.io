    <h1>Medium Task</h1>
    <p>
      I thought your group did a great job on the presentation and your activity was a nice change up from the usual.
      The instructions were easy to follow and the re-design activity was a great idea instead of having everyone start
      something from scratch.  This will allow you to compare them all from the same viewpoint.  Awesome job!

    <h1>Chicken Mingle Revised Website Design</h1>
    <img src="chicken.jpg" class="chicken" alt = "chicken mingle" />

    <p>
      The things I changed to revise the design are as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
        I changed the colour scheme to one that is more appealing and suited to the topic.
        </li>
        <li>
        I changed the fonts to a more appealing combo.
        </li>
        <li>
        I swapped the sides of the photo and text to make the site seem more balanced with the header.
        </li>
        <li>
        I increased the size of the fonts on the header and sign up button.
        </li>
        <li>
        I made a new logo (speaks for itself)
        </li>
        <li>
        I made the button more attractive with 3D effects and an outer glow.
        </li>
        <li>
        I added a gradient background to make the site more dynamic.
        </li>
      </ul>

    </p>
