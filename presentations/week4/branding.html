    <h1> Competitors</h1>
    <h2>Brands</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            Hershey's
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Cadbury
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Nestle
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Camino (fair-trade organic chocolate bars)
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Strengths</h2>
    <p>
        Hershey's, Cadbury and Nestle all hold huge amounts of the chocolate industry marketshare. They have generated huge profits and have effective ad campaigns. Camino is a less-known brand but they have built their brand on ethical practices that their much
        larger competitors do not use.
    </p>

    <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
    <p>
        Hershey's, Cadbury and Nestle all view profit as the utmost importance, but that comes at the expense of their workers who are not treated fairly. Camino needs to focus more money and effort on their ad campaigns and the mediums they choose to get their
        message to their target audience.
    </p>

    <h1>Logo Inspiration</h1>
    <h2>How the logo shows what the company is about</h2>
    <p>
        The logo I have made exemplifies the company's fun and loving attitude towards the products they sell. It gives feelings of happiness and well-being through the colour and texture use.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the logo is effective for the brand</h2>
    <p>
        The logo is effective because it follows the colour set used across all the brand's advertising and online presence. It also reflects the name of the company by using a parrot.
    </p>

    <h2>How the branding/logo makes us stand out</h2>
    <p>
        The branding and logo make this company stand out from the rest because it features an animal in the logo, unlike the competitors, and in my opinion provides much more visually appealing product packaging and overall brand image. This is a combination
        of the company's ethical practices and their use of vibrant colours and designs within their branding.
