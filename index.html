    <h1> Website Process</h1>
    <h2>Atom</h2>
    <p>
      Atom is the software program we use to code web pages in various languages like HTML5, CSS and Javascript.  It has many features to make coding more efficient and less prone to errors.
    </p>
    <h2>GitHub</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is an online developer's portal where we will be repositing our code.  The code from Atom, once saved to the local folder, can be pushed to our repository through a desktop application called Git for Desktop.
    </p>
    <h2>Git for Desktop</h2>
    <p>
      This is the software that works to sync our web projects between a local folder and the online repository.  It is important to never make changes from the repository itself, but rather directly from Atom into the local folder.
    </p>
    <h2>Git Page</h2>
    <p>
      This is a live version of your current web project based on the repository. To ensure it is up to date, you must sync it with your local folder.
